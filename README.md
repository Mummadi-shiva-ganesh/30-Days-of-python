# üêç 30 Days of Code in Python

## Overview

This repository contains my solutions to various coding challenges solved using Python over the course of 30 days. Each day, I tackle a new problem from platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, and CodeSignal. This README serves as a guide to navigate through my solutions.

## Structure

The repository is organized into folders corresponding to each day of the challenge. Inside each folder, you'll find:

- **Problem Description**: Brief overview of the problem.
- **Solution**: Python code solving the problem.
- **Input/Output Files**: Sample input and output files, if applicable.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the solutions provided. You can run the Python scripts locally to understand the solutions better. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions, please open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Progress

Here's a quick summary of my progress throughout the 30 days:
